##' @description Tools to ease working with eyetracker data. Currently focussed on my own work flow
##'     involving data from SRR Eyelink systems, although some stuff may be more generally
##'     useful. Functionality is a bit thin. Pitch in and help if you like. (It would be nice to
##'     have some code in README.Rmd that pulls the description from this file and inserts it
##'     there.)
