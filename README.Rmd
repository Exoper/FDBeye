FDBeye
====

Tools to ease working with eyetracker data. Currently focussed on my own work flow involving data from SRR Eyelink
systems, although some stuff may be more generally useful. Functionality is a bit thin. Pitch in and help if you like.

Before you dive into FDBeye, you might want to look at what else is available. See the list below.

Installing FDBeye
-----------------

First you should install <https://github.com/davebraze/FDB1>. Then, install *FDBeye* via devtools::install_github()
```R
install.packages("devtools")    ## if you don't already have it
library(devtools)
install_github("davebraze/FDBeye")
```

Other ET Tools
--------------

I've kept this short, limited to tools where the source code can be freely downloaded (i.e., you don't have to ask for
it), but note that at least some of the tools lack an Open Source License. Even so, I'm sure the list is incomplete. If
you know of something that seems like ought to be included, let me know. Better yet, fork this repository, make the
changes yourself, and send me a pull request.

### *R* packages ###

  * ***edf***: R package for reading SRR *edf files directly. Codebase is both R and C++, and requires SRR's
    edfapi. Source available on SRR's help forum (login via free account required)
    <https://www.sr-support.com/showthread.php?1416-Reading-EDF-files-in-GNU-R>.
  * ***em2***: "package for computing reading time measures for psycholinguistics," i.e. regional reading time
        measures. R package, underlying code mostly C++. Source available on github <https://github.com/cran/em2>.
  * ***emov***: Functions for fixation/saccade detection. On CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emov/>. Source is
    available on github <https://github.com/schw4b/emov>.
  * ***ETRAN***: Fixation detection, plotting. Available from this web site <https://sites.google.com/site/azhegallo/>, and
    written up in the journal _Perception_ here:
    <http://pec.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/08/14/0301006615594944.full>.
  * ***eyetracking***: Compute pixel-to-pixel and eye-to-screen distances. On CRAN
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eyetracking/>.
  * ***eyetrackingR***: Package oriented toward post-acquisition workflow, mostly for 'visual world' style studies. On
    CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eyetrackingR/>. It also has its own web site here:
    <http://www.eyetracking-r.com/>. The source is available on github <https://github.com/jwdink/eyetrackingR>.
  * ***fix_align.R***: automatically adjusts y coordinate of fixations in multi-line reading paradigm so that each falls
    on a specific line of text. As written, code is specific to SRR systems (requires SRR ASC files as input). At UMass
    <http://www.psych.umass.edu/PACLab/resources/>. Described in *Behav Res*:
    <http://people.umass.edu/eyelab/CohenBRM.pdf>. Source file (v0p92) includes the notice "(c) 2012, University of
    Massachussetts, All rights reserved". The latter bit seems to entail that the code may not be modified,
    redistributed, or even used without first obtaining explicit permission from UMass. Odd.
  * ***gazepath***: Functions for fixation/saccade detection. On CRAN
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gazepath/>. Source on github <https://github.com/cran/gazepath>.
  * ***saccades***: Functions for fixation/saccade detection. On CRAN
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/saccades/>. Source on github
    <https://github.com/tmalsburg/saccades>. author's website <http://pages.ucsd.edu/~tvondermalsburg/saccades/>.
  * ***ScaSim***: author's website <http://pages.ucsd.edu/~tvondermalsburg/scasim/>. Scan path similarity analysis. Last
    updated 2010.
