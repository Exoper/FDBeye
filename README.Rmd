FDBeye
====
Functions to ease working with eye-tracker data. Currently limited to eyelink input files, and even there functionality
is VERY thin. Pitch in and help if you like.

Install with devtools::install_github()
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("davebraze/FDBeye")
```
