FDBeye
====

Functions to ease working with eyetracker data. Currently limited to eyelink input files, and even there functionality
is thin. Pitch in and help if you like.

Installing FDBeye
-----------------

First you should install <https://github.com/davebraze/FDB1>. Then, install *FDBeye* via devtools::install_github()
```R
install.packages("devtools")    ## if you don't already have it
library(devtools)
install_github("davebraze/FDBeye")
```

Other ET Tools
--------------

I've limited this list to tools where the source code can be freely downloaded (i.e., you don't have to ask for
it). However, at least some of them do not carry an explicit Open Source License. The list is certainly incomplete. If
you're aware of something I've missed and seems like it should be included, let me know.

### *R* packages ###

  * *emov* Functions for fixation/saccade detection. On CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emov/>. Source is
    available on github <https://github.com/schw4b/emov>.
  * *ETRAN* Fixation detection, plotting. Available from this web site <https://sites.google.com/site/azhegallo/>, and
    written up in the journal _Perception_ here:
    <http://pec.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/08/14/0301006615594944.full>.
  * *eyetracking* Compute pixel-to-pixel and eye-to-screen distances. On CRAN
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eyetracking/>.
  * *eyetrackingR* Full workflow oriented package that seems mostly oriented toward 'visual world' style analysis. On CRAN
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eyetrackingR/>. It also has its own web site here:
    <http://www.eyetracking-r.com/>. The source is available on github <https://github.com/jwdink/eyetrackingR>.
  * *fix_align.R* automatically adjusts the vertical coordinate of each eye fixation in a multi-line reading experiment
    so that the fixation falls on a specific line of text, eliminating need to make ad hoc decisions about which line is
    fixated. At UMass <http://www.psych.umass.edu/PACLab/resources/>. Described in a *Behav Res*:
    <http://people.umass.edu/eyelab/CohenBRM.pdf>. Source file (v0p92) includes a copyright notice "(c) 2012, University of
    Massachussetts, All rights reserved," but no license.
  * *gazepath* Functions for fixation/saccade detection. On CRAN
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gazepath/>. Source on github <https://github.com/cran/gazepath>.
  * *saccades* Functions for fixation/saccade detection. On CRAN
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/saccades/>. Source on github
    <https://github.com/tmalsburg/saccades>. author's website <http://pages.ucsd.edu/~tvondermalsburg/saccades/>.
  * *ScaSim* author's website <http://pages.ucsd.edu/~tvondermalsburg/scasim/>. Scan path similarity analysis. Last
    updated 2010.

    fixation sequences. Java codebase. Last update in 2013.
  * *EyeSimplify* web site at <http://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/seminare/studpro06/eyesimplify/>. Convenience wrapper
    with automation for UMass tools (*EyeDoctor* etc.). Possibly superceded by *RoboDoc.py*. Python codebase. Last
    update in 2007.
