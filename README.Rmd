FDBeye
====
Functions to ease working with eyetracker data. Currently limited to eyelink input files, and even there functionality
is thin. Pitch in and help if you like.

First you should install <https://github.com/davebraze/FDB1>. Then, install this package via devtools::install_github()
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("davebraze/FDBeye")
```
